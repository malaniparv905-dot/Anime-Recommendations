            <p> Story Summary </p>
            <p>The story begins with Tanjiro Kamado, a kind-hearted boy who lives with his family in the mountains selling charcoal. His life is shattered when he returns home one day to find his family slaughtered by a demon. The only survivor is his younger sister, Nezuko, who has been turned into a demon but, unusually, retains some of her human memories and emotions. 
A Demon Slayer named Giyu Tomioka discovers them and, seeing Nezuko's unique humanity, directs Tanjiro to a master for training. Tanjiro undergoes rigorous training to become a Demon Slayer, vowing to find a cure to turn Nezuko human again and to avenge his family. Nezuko travels with him in a wooden box during the day, using her demon abilities to help him fight at night. 
Joined by fellow slayers Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira, Tanjiro embarks on a journey that leads him to battle increasingly powerful demons, including members of the elite Twelve Kizuki, who serve the Demon King, Muzan Kibutsuji. Throughout his journey, Tanjiro's unwavering resolve and compassion, even towards the demons he kills, drive him forward. 
The ultimate goal of the Demon Slayer Corps is the final confrontation with Muzan, which involves immense sacrifice and leads to Nezuko's eventual return to human form, securing a future free from demons.
