            <p> Story Summary </p>
            <p>
In a world where humanity is on the brink of extinction, the last survivors live within three enormous concentric walls for protection. Their enemies are the Titans, giant, mindless humanoids who devour humans seemingly without reason. The story begins when a colossal Titan breaches the outermost wall, devastating the hometown of a young boy named Eren Yeager.
After witnessing his mother's horrific death, Eren vows to eradicate every last Titan from the Earth. He, along with his childhood friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert, enlists in the military to fight back. They join the Survey Corps, the branch that dares to venture beyond the walls to reclaim territory and uncover the Titans' mysteries.
However, as Eren and his comrades fight, they begin to uncover dark, shocking truths. They learn about the origins of the Titans, the complex political history of their walled world, and the true nature of their enemies. The fight for simple survival evolves into a complex, brutal war, blurring the lines between friend and foe and exploring dark themes of freedom, sacrifice, and the devastating cycle of hatred.
